### Mission Rules
*Multiplayer Mission:* This mission is for 4 players (1 Defender and 3 Attackers). See _Multiplayer Appendix_ below.

*Select Agendas:* The Attackers each select 2 agendas as normal, but may not choose _both of_ 'Assassins' and 'Witch Hunter' because srsly dude. The Defender uses special agendas, see Appendix.

*Webway Gate:* The Webway Gate begins the game with 7 wounds remaining. Its 'Webway Strike' rule may not be used.

*Wraithbone Platform:* The Wraithbone Platform is Area Terrain. Subtract 1 from the hit roll when resolving an attack with a ranged weapon that targets an *INFANTRY* unit that is wholly on or within the terrain feature. _Handwave swirling psychic energies or similar BS._

*Reknit Wraithbone (Psychic Action - Warp Charge 5):* One *PSYKER CHARACTER* from your army can attempt to perform this psychic action in your Psychic Phase if it is within 6" of the Webway Gate. If successful, the Webway Gate regains D3 wounds.
